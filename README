* Description
  - dirdiff is a simple commandline tool to see the differnt files of
    directories. 
  - Files are different if they have a different name.

* Usage
  - Just run dirdiff <directory1> <directory2> and that is all.

  - Currently hidden files are simply omitted, that will change in the
    future.
  - Better difference criteria will also be added.
  - More options (like support for cyclic linking) are to come.
